## 10.1-2

> Using Figure 10.2 as a model, illustrate the result of each operation in the sequence `PUSH(S, 4)`, `PUSH(S, 1)`, `PUSH(S, 3)`, `POP(S)`, `PUSH(S, 8)`, and `POP(S)` on an initially empty stack `S` stored in array `S[1 : 6]`.

### Initial State
An initially empty stack `S` stored in array `S[1 : 6]`:
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   |   |   |   |   |   |
| **S.top = 0** |

### Operations

1. **PUSH(S, 4)**
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 4 |   |   |   |   |   |
   | **S.top = 1** |

2. **PUSH(S, 1)**
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 4 | 1 |   |   |   |   |
   | **S.top = 2** |

3. **PUSH(S, 3)**
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 4 | 1 | 3 |   |   |   |
   | **S.top = 3** |

4. **POP(S)**
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 4 | 1 | 3 |   |   |   |
   | **S.top = 2** |

5. **PUSH(S, 8)**
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 4 | 1 | 8 |   |   |   |
   | **S.top = 3** |

6. **POP(S)**
   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | 4 | 1 | 8 |   |   |   |
   | **S.top = 2** |

### Final State
After performing all the operations, the final state of stack `S` is as follows:
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 1 | 8 |   |   |   |
| **S.top = 2** |

### Reference Model

> Explain how to implement two stacks in one array `A[1 : n]` in such a way that neither stack overflows unless the total number of elements in both stacks together is `n`. The `PUSH` and `POP` operations should run in `O(1)` time.

### Answer

To implement two stacks in one array `A[1 : n]` such that neither stack overflows unless the total number of elements in both stacks together is `n`, you can use the following approach:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Let the array `A` have a size `n`.
   - Initialize two pointers:
     - `top1` for Stack 1 starting from the left (beginning of the array): `top1 = 0`
     - `top2` for Stack 2 starting from the right (end of the array): `top2 = n + 1`

2. **PUSH Operation**:
   - For Stack 1:
     - Check if there is space: `if top1 + top2 < n`
     - If true, increment `top1` and assign the value: `top1 += 1; A[top1] = x`
   - For Stack 2:
     - Check if there is space: `if top2 - 1 > top1`
     - If true, decrement `top2` and assign the value: `top2 -= 1; A[top2] = x`

3. **POP Operation**:
   - For Stack 1:
     - Check if the stack is not empty: `if top1 >= 1`
     - If true, retrieve the value: `value = A[top1]` and decrement `top1`: `top1 -= 1`
   - For Stack 2:
     - Check if the stack is not empty: `if top2 <= n`
     - If true, retrieve the value: `value = A[top2]` and increment `top2`: `top2 += 1`

Rewrite `ENQUEUE` and `DEQUEUE` to detect underflow and overflow of a queue.

### Answer

To detect overflow and underflow in a queue implemented using a circular array (1-indexed), we can use the following approach:

### ENQUEUE Operation

```plaintext
Algorithm ENQUEUE(Q,x)
// Check if the queue is full
// note this will always leave a free space between the tail and the head,
// but we do this so we can distinguish the full case from the empty case.
if (Q.tail + 1 == Q.head) or ((Q.tail == Q.size) and Q.head == 1) then
    Error "Overflow"
else
    Q[Q.tail] ← x
    // Move tail to the next position, wrapping around if necessary
    if Q.tail == Q.size then
        Q.tail ← 1
    else
        Q.tail ← Q.tail + 1
    end if
end if

```

### DEQUEUE Operation
```plaintext
Algorithm DEQUEUE(Q)
    Input: Queue Q
    Output: Element from Queue Q or Underflow Error
    // Check if the queue is empty
    if Q.head == Q.tail then
        Error "Underflow"
    else
        x ← Q[Q.head]
        // Move head to the next position, wrapping around if necessary
        if Q.head == Q.size then
            Q.head = 1
        else:
            Q.head = Q.head + 1 
        
        end if
    return x
```

Whereas a stack allows insertion and deletion of elements at only one end, and a queue allows insertion at one end and deletion at the other end, a deque (double-ended queue, pronounced like "deck") allows insertion and deletion at both ends. Write four O(1) time procedures to insert elements into and delete elements from both ends of a deque implemented by an array.

### Answer

To implement a deque using a circular array (1-indexed), we can use the following approach for the four operations: `enqueue_head`, `enqueue_tail`, `dequeue_head`, and `dequeue_tail`.

### Initialization
```plaintext
Algorithm INITIALIZE-DEQUE(size)
    Input: size of the deque
    Output: An initialized deque Q
    Q.size ← size + 1  // Extra space to differentiate full/empty
    Q.array ← new array of size + 1
    Q.head ← 1
    Q.tail ← 1
    Q.isFull ← False
```
```plaintext
Algorithm ENQUEUE_HEAD(Q, x)
    Input: Deque Q, element x
    Output: None or Overflow Error
    if Q.isFull then
        Error "Overflow"
    else
        if Q.head == 1 then
            Q.head ← Q.size
        else
            Q.head ← Q.head - 1
        end if
        Q.array[Q.head] ← x
        Q.isFull ← Q.head == Q.tail
    end if
```


```plaintext
Algorithm ENQUEUE_TAIL(Q, x)
    Input: Deque Q, element x
    Output: None or Overflow Error
    if Q.isFull then
        Error "Overflow"
    else
        Q.array[Q.tail] ← x
        if Q.tail == Q.size then
            Q.tail ← 1
        else
            Q.tail ← Q.tail + 1
        end if
        Q.isFull ← Q.head == Q.tail
    end if
```

```plaintext
Algorithm DEQUEUE_HEAD(Q)
    Input: Deque Q
    Output: Element from Deque Q or Underflow Error
    if Q.head == Q.tail and not Q.isFull then
        Error "Underflow"
    else
        value ← Q.array[Q.head]
        if Q.head == Q.size then
            Q.head ← 1
        else
            Q.head ← Q.head + 1
        end if
        Q.isFull ← False
        return value
    end if
```

```plaintext
Algorithm DEQUEUE_TAIL(Q)
    Input: Deque Q
    Output: Element from Deque Q or Underflow Error
    if Q.head == Q.tail and not Q.isFull then
        Error "Underflow"
    else
        if Q.tail == 1 then
            Q.tail ← Q.size
        else
            Q.tail ← Q.tail - 1
        end if
        value ← Q.array[Q.tail]
        Q.isFull ← False
        return value
    end if

Show how to implement a queue using two stacks. Analyze the running time of the queue operations.

### Answer

To implement a queue using two stacks, you can use the following approach. (Note, unlike other typical answers to this question, I don't assume the queue is infinitely sized. Instead, I assume we implement the queue in two equal-sized static arrays. This seems more natural to me, since in the previous questions we implemented queues using a circular buffer where there was a limit on the size of the queue – i.e. we could "overflow". I wanted to keep that feature here, not just underflow).

### Initialization
```plaintext
Algorithm INITIALIZE-QUEUE(Q, stack_size)
    Q.S1 ← new empty stack of size stack_size
    Q.S2 ← new empty stack of size stack_size
    Q.size ← 0
    Q.max_size ← stack_size
```
```
Algorithm ENQUEUE(Q, x)
    if Q.size == Q.max_size then
        Error "Overflow"
    else
        Push x onto Q.S1
        Q.size ← Q.size + 1
    end if
```
```plaintext
Algorithm DEQUEUE(Q)
    if Q.size == 0 then
        Error "Underflow"
    else
         // If S2 isn't empty, then S2.top gives us the head of the queue
        if Q.S2 is empty then 
            while Q.S1 is not empty do
                x ← Pop from Q.S1
                Push x onto Q.S2
            end while
        end if
        x ← Pop from Q.S2
        Q.size ← Q.size - 1
        return x
    end if
```

Enqueue is O(1). Dequeue is worst case O(N).

## Comments

I struggled with this question a little bit, and it is instructive to think about why. I believe I was misled by my previous contact with queues. In particular, I'd seen queues and stacks implemented in fixed-size arrays. These implementations came with certain features that I then, at least implicitly I think, took to be necessary for a queue. In the fixed-size array-based implementation of a queue, the Tail pointer always pointed to the next available space in the queue and the Head pointer to the front of the queue. In this two-stack-based implementation, there was no explicit pointer to the tail or head of the queue. Instead, the tail of the queue is implicitly either infront  of the top element in the first stack (i.e. S1.top + 1) or, I suppose, before the first element of the S2 stack if we are dequeuing (although this second possibility is not really relevant for practical purposes). In other words, although we can't explicitly access the head and tail of the stack as in a fixed-size array implementation, we still can do what an queue does: enqueue and dequeue. From now on it is important that I really keep in mind this level of abstraction. A queue is any collection of data that supports enqueueing and dequeuing (and nothing else, we might add). A data structure is any collection of data that supports certain operations. So, for exmaple, if we have an implementation which allows us to remove the first element we added and add an element to the first available space, we have a queue. Anything else is implementation. I will try and keep this way of thinking in mind going forward.
