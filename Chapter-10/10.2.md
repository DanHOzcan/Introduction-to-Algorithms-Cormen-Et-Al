The dynamic-set operation UNION takes two disjoint sets S_1 and S_2 as input, and returns a set S = S_1 \cup S_2 consisting of all 
the element of S_1 and S_2. The sets S_1 and S_2 are usually destroyed by the operation. Show how to support UNION in O(1) time using 
a suitable list data structure.

**Answer**:

First adjust the usual linked list class to keep track of the tail.

```plaintext
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def list_insert(self, x, y):
        x.next = y.next
        x.prev = y
        if y.next is not None:
            y.next.prev = x
        else:
            self.tail = x
        y.next = x

    def list_prepend(self, x):
        x.next = self.head
        x.prev = None
        if self.head is not None:
            self.head.prev = x
        else:
            self.tail = x
        self.head = x

    def list_delete(self, x):
        if x.prev is not None:
            x.prev.next = x.next
        else:
            self.head = x.next
        if x.next is not None:
            x.next.prev = x.prev
        else:
            self.tail = x.prev
```

Then we can define the union operation simply as follows.

```plaintext

def union(list1, list2):
    if list1.head is None:  # S1 is empty
        list1.head = list2.head
        list1.tail = list2.tail
    elif S2.head is not None:  # S1 is not empty and S2 is not empty
        list1.tail.next = list2.head
        list2.head.prev = list1.tail
        list1.tail = list2.tail
    # list2 is destroyed by dereferencing its head and tail
    list2.head = list2.tail = None
    return list1
```

Give a $\Theta (n)$-time nonrecursive procedure that reverses a singly linked list of elements. The procedure should use no more than constant storage beyond that needed for the list itself.

_**Answer**:_
```plaintext

LIST-REVERSE(L)

    # 1: Initialize pointers
    prev « NIL
    current « L.head

    # 2: Iterate through the list
    while current ≠ NIL do
        next « current.next    # Save the next node before updating current.next
        current.next « prev    # Reverse the pointer
        prev « current         # Move prev forward
        current « next         # Move current forward

    # 3: Update the head
    L.head « prev

```

Explain how to implement doubly linked lists using only one pointer value `x.np` per item instead of the usual two (`next` and `prev`). Assume that all pointer values can be interpreted as `k`-bit integers, and define `x.np = x.next XOR x.prev`, the `k`-bit "exclusive-or" of `x.next` and `x.prev`. The value `NIL` is represented by `0`. Be sure to describe what information you need to access the head of the list. Show how to implement the **SEARCH**, **INSERT**, and **DELETE** operations on such a list. Also, show how to reverse such a list in \( O(1) \) time.

_**Answer**:_

(i) Updated Search Algorithm

Recall the algorithm for searching a doubly-linked list (P. 260):

```plaintext
Algorithm LIST-SEARCH(L,k)
    current = L.head
    while current ≠ NIL and current.key ≠ k do
        current « current.next
    return current
```

We first prove that c = a $\oplus$ b implies both (1) a = c $\oplus$ b and (2) (1) b = c $\oplus$ a. This will allow us recover the x.next and x.prev operators from the single x.np operator.

Proof.
Suppose c = a \$\oplus\$ b. By the fact that c \$\oplus\$ b = c \$\oplus\$ b and by substitution, we have c \$\oplus\$ b = (a \$\oplus\$ b) \$\oplus\$ b. Then we reason as follows.
1. c \$\oplus\$ b  =  b \$\oplus\$ (a \$\oplus\$ b)  (Commutativity)
2. c \$\oplus\$ b  =  b \$\oplus\$ (b \$\oplus\$ a)  (Commutativity)
3. c \$\oplus\$ b  =  (b \$\oplus\$ b) \$\oplus\$ a  (Associativity)
4. c \$\oplus\$ b  =  0 \$\oplus\$ a                 (Self-Inverse)
5. c \$\oplus\$ b  =  a                              (Identity)

The proof for (2) is identical. It follows that x.next = x.np \$\oplus\$ x.prev and x.prev = x.np \$\oplus\$ x.next.

```plaintext
Algorithm XOR-LIST-SEARCH(L,k)
    # Initialise pointers
    prev « NIL
    current « L.head
    # Traverse list searching for element
    while current.key ≠ k and current ≠ NIL do
        next « current.np XOR prev
        prev « current
        current « next
    return current
```


        
(ii) Updated Insert Algorithm

Recall the algorithm for inserting an element into a doubly-linked list (P. 261):
    
```plaintext
Input: x: element to be inserted; y: pointer to an object in the list
Algorithm LIST-INSERT(x,y)
'''
Inserts x immediately following y in a doubly-linked list.
'''
1.    x.next « y.next
2.    x.prev « y
3.    if y.next ≠ NIL
4.        y.next.prev « x
5.    y.next « x
```

To replicate this for the XOR version of doubly-linked lists, we need to make use of the facts, just proven, that x.next = x.np \$\oplus\$ x.prev and x.prev = x.np \$\oplus\$ x.next. Since we want to update the next part of the np pointer, we need to find the previous element of y. Also, since we want to update the prev pointer of the element after y to point back to x, we need to be able to 

```plaintext
Algorithm XOR-FIND-PREVIOUS-NODE(L,k)
    # Initialise pointers
    prev « NIL
    current « L.head
    # Traverse list searching for element
    while current ≠ k and current ≠ NIL do
        next « current.np XOR prev
        prev « current
        current « next
    return prev
```

Rather than this, since we have to get y_next aswell, we can have a FIND-NEIGHBOURS function:

For this strategy, we need to include this list as an argument to the function. This doesn't seem like a problem.

```plaintext
Algorithm XOR-LIST-INSERT(L, x, y)
'''
Inserts x immediately following y in an XOR linked list.
'''
1. y_prev ← XOR-FIND-PREVIOUS-NODE(L, y)
2. y_next ← y.np XOR y_prev
3. x.np ← y XOR y_next
4. y.np ← y_prev XOR x
5. if y_next ≠ NIL then
6.     y_next.np ← (y_next.np XOR y) XOR x
```
