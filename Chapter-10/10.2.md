The dynamic-set operation UNION takes two disjoint sets S_1 and S_2 as input, and returns a set S = S_1 \cup S_2 consisting of all 
the element of S_1 and S_2. The sets S_1 and S_2 are usually destroyed by the operation. Show how to support UNION in O(1) time using 
a suitable list data structure.

First adjust the usual linked list class to keep track of the tail.

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    def list_insert(self, x, y):
        x.next = y.next
        x.prev = y
        if y.next is not None:
            y.next.prev = x
        else:
            self.tail = x
        y.next = x

    def list_prepend(self, x):
        x.next = self.head
        x.prev = None
        if self.head is not None:
            self.head.prev = x
        else:
            self.tail = x
        self.head = x

    def list_delete(self, x):
        if x.prev is not None:
            x.prev.next = x.next
        else:
            self.head = x.next
        if x.next is not None:
            x.next.prev = x.prev
        else:
            self.tail = x.prev
```

Then we can define the union operation simply as follows.

```plaintext

def union(list1, list2):
    if list1.head is None:  # S1 is empty
        list1.head = list2.head
        list1.tail = list2.tail
    elif S2.head is not None:  # S1 is not empty and S2 is not empty
        list1.tail.next = list2.head
        list2.head.prev = list1.tail
        list1.tail = list2.tail
    # list2 is destroyed by dereferencing its head and tail
    list2.head = list2.tail = None
    return list1
```
