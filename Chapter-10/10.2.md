The dynamic-set operation UNION takes two disjoint sets S_1 and S_2 as input, and returns a set S = S_1 \cup S_2 consisting of all 
the element of S_1 and S_2. The sets S_1 and S_2 are usually destroyed by the operation. Show how to support UNION in O(1) time using 
a suitable list data structure.

class LinkedListNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None
